ONTRAPORT Front-End Evaluation, Short Test
=============================

Howdy! Welcome to the ONTRAPORT front-end short test. Thank you for your interest in working with us.
Before we can continue with your application we would like you to complete a short test.  


###Test description:
The objective of this test is to have you complete a short front-end task. This will help 
us gauge your understanding of frontend engineering and let us know if you are ready to take our long test. Please use 
any industry standards, best practices, performance tips and 
code style that you support. We are looking for engineers with varying skill levels so do your best.
Thank you for taking the time to take our test.

###Requirements:
0. All computation must take place on the client. Sorry no posting to the server, we want to see your
   front end skills.

1. To get started fork this repo into your own GitHub account. 

2. Without changing the existing form markup in `index.html`, create a script that on form submit 
   prepends the contents of the from `<input type="text" name="post" placeholder="thoughts?"/>` 
   to `<div id="page">`. 

3. For each input value prepended, concatenate the second of the current browser date to 
   the input value.

4. Once you finish coding, please
   a. submit a pull request
   b. then send an email with the subject line "Front-end short test" to recruiting@ontraport.com. Make sure to include your resume and a link to the pull request. 

There is a time and place for javascript frameworks. This might not be it. We want to see your javascript skills so we 
would like to see your solution be done in vanilla javascript, jQuery or a similar javascript library. That being said 
if you feel strongly that this problem needs a framework by all means use one and tell us why.

###Example:
Check out the GIF below to see a working example of what a finished test might act like.

Good Luck!
