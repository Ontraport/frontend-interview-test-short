ONTRAPORT Front-End Evaluation, Sharon Yang's Attempt
=============================

If you haven't done so, go ahead and install Python from here:
https://www.python.org/download/

Assuming you have Python on your computer, and your computer is
Linux base (Mac OS is tested, too), do the following:

```
./setup.sh
flask/bin/python run.py
```

Your website should be running on localhost, port 5000, or simply:
http://localhost:5000/


Screenshots
=====

I have run the code on my personal computer and have screenshots of some posts up in the "screenshots" folder. Free free to look into them to get a feel of the project before installations.


Again, thank you for your time, and I hope you will enjoy!


-Sharon
